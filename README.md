# Twitter Decentralized App "Clone" Project

This is a school project. Our professor asked us to create a twitter clone using Hardhat and I'm working on frontend. That's pretty much it.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm run start
npx tailwindcss -i ./tailwindcss/base.css -o ./src/css/App.css --watch

```
